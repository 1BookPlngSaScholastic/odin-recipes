    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <h4>
      This is an incredibly easy rich and satisfying ice cream dessert made with
      ice cream sandwiches and fudge sauce. <br />
      This keeps in the freezer very well and can be eaten straight from the
      freezer.
    </h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) can chocolate syrup</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>19 ice cream sandwiches</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
      <li>1 cup salted peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Whisk together cream and 3 tablespoons sugar in a microwave-safe bowl
        until combined. <br />
        Cook in the microwave until warm, 1 to 2 minutes; whisk again to
        dissolve sugar. <br />
        Whisk in egg yolks and vanilla until smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour cream mixture into 2 ramekins set in a roasting pan. <br />
        Pour enough hot water into the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the
        ramekins.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set but slightly jiggly in
        the center when shaken, about 50 minutes. <br />Remove ramekins from hot
        water and chill in the refrigerator until cold, at least 2 hours.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the top of each dessert. <br />
        Use a kitchen torch to melt and lightly toast sugar topping until brown
        and bubbly, about 30 seconds. <br />Let sugar topping cool to harden
        before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
